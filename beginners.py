# In the VS CODE there is built-in function called Source Control to commit and push.
# Source Control is to be found on the left side - the icon with 3 branches from the top on the icon bar.
# In the Source Control panel we entered a message and ticked it (Commit) & Sync Changes
# commit (the check symbol) --> locking the file in
# push --> it will take everything on our machine and it will push it online
# pull --> it downloads the file from the cloud to the personal PC
# get clone and paste the copied link --> connets to (clones) the folder in GitHub we work on
