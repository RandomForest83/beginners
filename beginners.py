# In the VS CODE there is built-in function called Source Control to commit and push.
# Source Control is to be found on the left side - the icon with 3 branches from the top on the icon bar.
# In the Source Control panel we entered a message and ticked it & Sync Changes
# commit --> locking the file in
# push --> it will take everything on our machine and it will push it online
